#     House Points Configuration     #
#        by Kimberly Boynton         #
######################################

# This section is configuration to setup houses.  They can be any name you would like,
# but whatever you name them must also appear on the sign for points.

# If you name them something too long to fit on a minecraft sign, then you will not be
# able to make a points sign.

# The points portion of this updates on load and unload.

# The block can be set to anything in the Material enum of spigot:
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html

# ChatColor is the color that the house will appear when in chat.  Pick this from ChatColor enum.

# Short cut is a short cut you can use when doing the /house command to replace the
# house so you don't have to type it out.
#
# custom-item is the ability to use custom models with an armor stand. Since there are two ways of doing this,
# I have set it up so you can do it both ways.
#
# The first way uses Optifine where it renames a block and places it as a helmet
# For this, {rank} needs to be located where you will rename it and the rank will be:
# 1 = 1st place, 2 = 2nd etc...
#
# The second way uses the Custom Model Data on Item Meta and sets the id.
# For the Custom Item Meta you will set the original ID for 1st place, and you need
# at least 3 more slots (All IDs must be 7 digits long)
# ie: 1000001 = 1st gryffindor, 1000001 = 2nd gryffindor, 1000003 = 3rd gryffindor, 1000004 = 4th gryffindor,
#     1000005 = 1st ravenclaw, 1000006 = 2nd ravenclaw ... etc
# You only need to put the 1st place number, the rest will be done for you, this is the id that you put into the
# resource pack json for the specific block type.
